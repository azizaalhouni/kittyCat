          <p>THE cat went here and there</p>
          <p>And the moon spun round like a top,</p>
          <p>And the nearest kin of the moon,</p>
          <p>The creeping cat, looked up.</p>
          <p>Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,</p>
          <p>For, wander and wail as he would,</p>
          <p>The pure cold light in the sky</p>
          <p>Troubled his animal blood.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Minnaloushe runs in the grass
          <p>Lifting his delicate feet.</p>
          <p>Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?</p>
          <p>When two close kindred meet.</p>
          <p>What better than call a dance?</p>
          <p>Maybe the moon may learn,</p>
          <p>Tired of that courtly fashion,</p>
          <p> new dance turn.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</p>
          <p>From moonlit place to place,</p>
          <p>The sacred moon overhead</p>
          <p>Has taken a new phase.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils</p>
          <p>Will pass from change to change,</p>
          <p>And that from round to crescent,</p>
          <p>From crescent to round they range?</p>
          <p>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</p>
          <p>Alone, important and wise,</p>
          <p>And lifts to the changing moon</p>
          <p>His changing eyes.</p>
          <br>
